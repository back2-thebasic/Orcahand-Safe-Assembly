"""Find out where a policy loses the task.

    python -m orca_rl.diagnose --model runs/run3/final_model.zip

A solve needs two separate things to go right: the red face has to enter the
15-degree cone, and it has to *stay* there for `hold_steps`. A single
solves/episode number cannot tell those apart, and the fixes point in opposite
directions -- so measure them separately before tuning anything.

Reads out:

  reach      how close the policy gets to each goal it is handed
  convert    of the times it does enter the cone, how often it holds long enough
  where time goes

Interpretation is printed at the bottom.
