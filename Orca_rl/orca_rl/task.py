"""Continuous in-hand cube reorientation for the ORCA hand.

This fixes three problems with ``orca_sim``'s stock ``OrcaHandRightCubeOrientation``:

1. **The reward paid the policy to stall.**  The stock reward is
   ``0.5 * (alignment + 1)`` every step *and* the episode terminates on success,
   so hovering just outside the tolerance for 200 steps scores ~196 while
   actually solving in 20 steps scores ~10.  Here the shaping term is
   potential-based (it sums to the total *improvement*, not to elapsed time)
   and success does not end the episode -- it awards a bonus and hands the
   policy a new goal.  Doing the task is now strictly better than not.

2. **The success test did not require holding the cube.**  A random policy hits
   the stock criterion 21% of the time, mostly by flinging the cube and
   catching a lucky frame mid-tumble.  Success here requires the cube to be
   in contact with the hand, above ``in_hand_height``, and aligned for
   ``hold_steps`` consecutive steps.

3. **The action space was raw joint angles with per-joint ranges.**  Actions
   here are always ``[-1, 1]^17``; the env maps them onto the actuator ranges,
   so no ``RescaleAction`` wrapper is needed.  ``action_mode="relative"``
   (the default) treats the action as a delta on the previous target, which
   trains better and produces much smoother trajectories -- which matters if
   these are ever going to run on real tendon-driven hardware.

Optional physics randomization (off by default) is included as the natural
next step toward sim-to-real.
